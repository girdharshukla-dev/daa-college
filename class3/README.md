Instructions
Problem:

Given an array and an integer k, count the number of pairs (i, j) such that arr[i] + arr[j] == k. 

Tasks: 

Implement a brute-force solution and analyze its time complexity. 
Can you solve the problem in O(n log n) time? If yes, implement this solution and explain how it works.  
Is there a solution with better time complexity? If yes, implement that as well. 
Note: If there are any limitations for any of your algorithms, make sure to mention that as well.



Note: Submit the assignment in word or pdf format. Copy paste the code and screenshot of the output in the document and answer all the questions asked in the assigned order.
Make sure to add a front page to your document which contains institute name and logo, lab assignment no., subject name, subject code, your name, scholar no. and professor's name.
